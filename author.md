I am Keith Robertson, also known as fearless / mrfearless. I was born in Scotland but now live in Ireland.

I have a Teacher Trainer Diploma in Information Technology Skills and have worked as a professional programmer for over 5 years. I have used a number of programming languages in production environments and custom built applications for clients using: dBASE, Clipper, Foxpro, Visual Foxpro and Visual Basic. 

I remember being interesting in coding from a young age, starting with the basic language on the ZX Spectrum 48K. 

Over the years I have managed to develop and enhance my skills with other technologies and programming languages that interested me. 

I recall a time in the past, when my then current boss - who was coding in x86 assembler - said to me: 

> Its not for you. You wouldnt be able to understand the low level nature of assembler, its too advanced for you, you should stick to basic and clipper instead.

I silenty vowed I would understand this language, taken it as a challenge, and I took every opportunity I could to read all the books and articles on assembly language i could find.

That was over 15 years ago. I never told him of my self-taught accomplishment and as far as I know he never learnt that I did infact suceed in learning assembler - including more advanced topics than my boss would have expected.

Learning is a great and rewarding experience. And sharing that knowledge is a way of repaying that.

Never let anyone tell you that you can't do something.
