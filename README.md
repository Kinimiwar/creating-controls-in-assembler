# Creating Controls In Assembler

A book, by [mrfearless](https://github.com/mrfearless), published on [Gitbook.com](/Gitbook.com), about creating controls in assembly language.

The book introduces the reader to my journey and techniques I discovered and evolved over time, for creating custom controls using the windows win32 API and Microsoft's Macro Assembler \(Masm\).

It covers the main areas of developing an example control, SimpleButton, which the reader can then use as basis for creating their own custom controls.
