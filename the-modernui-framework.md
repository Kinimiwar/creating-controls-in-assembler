# The ModernUI Framework

Readers might be interested in my other project which is related to creating custom controls in assembler: ModernUI

It uses many of the techniques that we have covered in creating controls and implementing property constants to allow the end-user to easily customize the controls look and/or behaviour.

There is two versions of the project, one for x86 32bit windows, and one for x64 64bit windows:

ModernUI

ModernUI64 

For years, new control types and UI designs for operating system and web have progressed, whilst older win32 base controls which are used by win32 assemblers \(masm32 etc\) have remained untouched. The ModernUI project has been created to help modernize these existing controls and add to them. The main goals of the project are:

* Provide a modern update to existing win32 base class visual controls.
* Add new control types to reflect newer UI/UX design influences.
* Emulate control types from UWP, WPF, .Net 
  &
   Web 2.0 platforms.
